## 🚲 Bay Wheels Bike Rental Analysis

This project explores patterns in bike rental demand in San Francisco using Python and real-world data from Bay Wheels. I analyzed how **time of day**, **temperature**, and **holiday status** influence rider behavior. Key visualizations helped identify when and why demand peaks.

### 🔍 Key Insights:
- **Peak Usage**: Highest rentals occur during weekday commute hours (8–9 AM and 5–6 PM), indicating strong commuter usage.
- **Weather Sensitivity**: Rentals decrease on cold or rainy days, with peak usage during moderate temperatures (10–25°C).
- **Holiday Trends**: Weekends and holidays shift toward more leisure-based riding, with balanced activity throughout the day.

### ✅ Strategic Recommendations:
- **Smart Staffing**: Hire more workers during weekday commute hours and reduce during low-demand weather periods.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Run promotions during warm weekends and holidays to attract more casual riders.
- **Bike Rebalancing**: Ensure high-demand stations are restocked during morning and evening peaks.
