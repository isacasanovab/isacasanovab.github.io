## Bay Wheels Bike Rental Analysis

This project presents a data-driven analysis of bike rental usage in San Francisco using Python. The objective was to examine how various factors—such as hour of day, weather conditions, and holiday status—affect user demand. The analysis employed tools including `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to generate meaningful visualizations and insights.

### Key Findings
- **Commuter Demand**: Rental activity peaks during weekday commute hours (8–9 AM and 5–6 PM), indicating heavy use by commuters.
- **Weather Influence**: Optimal rental activity occurs at moderate temperatures between 10°C and 25°C, while colder or rainy days show decreased usage.
- **Holiday Patterns**: Holidays and weekends shift user behavior toward more balanced, recreational usage across the day.

### Strategic Recommendations
- **Operational Efficiency**: Schedule staffing in alignment with peak demand periods to ensure service availability.
- **Bike Redistribution**: Enhance inventory management by prioritizing bike availability at high-demand locations during peak hours.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Promote rental services during favorable weather and holidays to attract casual riders.
